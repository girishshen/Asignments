        "\n",
        "  -> In Python, generators are a simple way to create iterators. An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a sequence of values, one value at a time. The key characteristic of a generator is that it generates values on the fly as they are requested, rather than creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This \"lazy\" evaluation makes generators memory-efficient and suitable for working with potentially large or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Generators are defined using functions that use the yield keyword.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Here's the syntax:\n",

        "    yield value2\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) def keyword:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Just like a regular function, a generator is defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses for parameters.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) yield keyword:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  This is what makes a function a generator. Instead of using return to return a value and exit the function, yield is used to produce a value and temporarily suspend the function's execution.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  iii) Suspending and Resuming:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the code within the function immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. When you iterate over this generator object (e.g., using a for loop or the next() function), the code inside the generator function runs until the first yield statement is encountered. The value after yield is produced, and the generator's state (including the values of local variables) is saved. The next time you request a value from the generator, execution resumes from where it left off, continuing until the next yield or the function finishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iv) StopIteration:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  When the generator function finishes executing without encountering a yield statement, it automatically raises a StopIteration exception, which signals to the caller that there are no more values to be generated.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  v) For Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  def count_up_to_five():\n",
        "\n",
        "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",

        "      yield i\n",
        "\n",
        "  for number in count_up_to_five():   # Using the generator\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(number)\n",

        "      \n",
        "      c) yield i produces each number i and pauses the generator.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      d) The for loop outside the function iterates over the generator object returned by count_up_to_five(). Each iteration of the outer loop requests the next value from the generator, which resumes execution until the next yield.\n",

        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Generators offer several advantages over regular functions when it comes to generating sequences of values:\n",
        "\n",
        "      i) Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      This is often the most significant advantage. Regular functions that build and return a list or other collection of all items must create and store the entire sequence in memory before returning it. Generators, on the other hand, produce values one at a time using the yield keyword. They generate a value and then pause their execution, maintaining their state. This is incredibly useful for large datasets or infinite sequences where storing everything in memory would be impossible or impractical.\n",
        "\n",
        "      ii) Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Generators are \"lazy\" in that they only compute and yield a value when it is requested. This means you don't spend time and resources computing values that you might not actually use. This is beneficial when dealing with potentially long sequences where you might only need the first few items.\n",
        "\n",
        "      iii) Simpler Code for Iterators:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Creating a custom iterator class in Python requires implementing the __iter__() and __next__() methods. Generators provide a much simpler and more concise way to achieve the same functionality using the yield keyword. The generator function handles the state management automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "      iv) Can Represent Infinite Sequences:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Since generators produce values one at a time, they can be used to represent potentially infinite sequences of data. A regular function that tries to create an infinite list would run out of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "      v) Pipeline Creation:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Generators can be easily chained together to create data processing pipelines. One generator can yield values that are then processed by another generator, and so on. This allows for efficient data manipulation without creating intermediate data structures in memory.\n",
