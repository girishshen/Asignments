        "1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects can be defined as instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. OOP uses concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Think of it like the architectural plan for a building â€“ the plan itself isn't the building, but it describes what the building will look like and how it will function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->  In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from the blueprint defined by the class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  An object is a specific realization of a class. While a class is a general template, an object is a particular example of that template.\n",
        "\n",
        "  An object encapsulates both data (its attributes) and the operations that can be performed on that data (its methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Each object has its own state (the current values of its attributes) and a unique identity that distinguishes it from other objects, even if they are instances of the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "      i) It deals with hiding complexity and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "      ii) Its goal is to provide a simplified view of an object, allowing you to interact with it at a higher level without needing to know the intricate details of its implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "      iii) It is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces (in some languages), which define a common interface for a group of related objects. This allows you to treat objects of different types in a uniform way.\n",
        "\n",
        "      iv) Example: - Think of driving a car. You interact with the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake (the essential features), but you don't need to know how the engine, transmission, and braking system work internally (the hidden complexity).\n",
        "      \n",
        "      \n",
        "      Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "      i) It deals with bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). It also involves controlling access to the data to protect its integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "      ii) Its goal to prevent direct access to an object's internal state from outside the class, forcing interactions to go through the defined methods. This allows for better control over how the data is modified and ensures that the object remains in a valid state.\n",
        "\n",
        "      iii) It is achieved by making attributes private or protected and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "      iv) Example: - Think of a capsule containing medicine. The capsule bundles the medicine (data) and protects it from the outside environment. You take the capsule (interact through a defined method) to get the medicine, but you don't directly interact with the medicine inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Dunder methods in Python are special methods that have double underscores before and after their names, such as __init__ or __str__. They are also known as magic methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  These methods are not typically called directly by the programmer, but rather are invoked by Python in specific situations. They allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in operations and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Some common examples of dunder methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) __init__: Called when an object is created (the constructor).\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ii) __str__: Defines the string representation of an object, used by the str() function and print().\n",
        "  \n",
        "  iii) __repr__: Defines the official string representation of an object, typically used for debugging.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  iv) __add__, __sub__, __mul__, etc.: Define how objects of your class interact with arithmetic operators.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  v) __len__: Defines the length of an object, used by the len() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class to inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class. This existing class is often referred to as the \"parent,\" \"base,\" or \"superclass,\" while the new class is called the \"child,\" \"derived,\" or \"subclass.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  Its Benefits includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) Reusability:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The primary benefit of inheritance is code reusability. Instead of writing the same attributes and methods in multiple classes, you can define them once in a base class and have other classes inherit them.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) Establishing Relationships:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. For example, a \"Dog\" \"is a\" type of \"Animal,\" or a \"Car\" \"is a\" type of \"Vehicle.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  iii) Extending Functionality:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Derived classes can not only inherit from the base class but also add their own unique attributes and methods, or even override the methods inherited from the base class to provide specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->  Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to use a single interface to represent different underlying types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  There are two main types of polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):\n",
        "\n",
        "  This type of polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different number of arguments or different types of arguments). The compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments provided at compile time. Python does not directly support method overloading in the same way as languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):\n",
        "\n",
        "  This type of polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When the method is called on an object, the actual method executed is determined at runtime based on the object's type. This is a core aspect of how polymorphism works in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism makes code more flexible and easier to extend. You can write code that works with objects of a base class, and it will automatically work with objects of any derived class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) Code Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  It promotes code reusability by allowing you to define common interfaces in base classes and have derived classes provide their specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iii) Simplified Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "  It simplifies code by allowing you to treat related objects in a uniform way, reducing the need for conditional statements to handle different object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example (in Python):\n",
        "\n",
        "  Consider a base class Animal with a method speak(). Derived classes like Dog and Cat can override the speak() method to provide their specific sounds (\"Bark!\" and \"Meow!\"). You can then have a list of Animal objects (which could be Dog or Cat objects) and call the speak() method on each of them without knowing their specific type. The correct speak() method for each object will be called at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). It also involves controlling access to the data to protect its integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like public, private, or protected in the same way as some other languages (like Java or C++), it uses naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility and provides mechanisms to control access:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) Public Attributes and Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "  By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are considered public. This means they can be accessed and modified from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) Protected Attributes and Methods (using a single underscore _):\n",
        "\n",
        "  Attributes and methods prefixed with a single underscore (_) are conventionally considered \"protected.\" This is a weak indication to other programmers that these members are intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses. However, they can still be accessed from outside the class if someone chooses to do so. It's more of a convention for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iii) Private Attributes and Methods (using double underscores __):\n",
        "\n",
        "  Attributes and methods prefixed with double underscores (__) are \"name-mangled\" by the Python interpreter. This makes them less accessible from outside the class. When you try to access a name-mangled attribute or method from outside the class, you'll typically get an AttributeError. This mechanism is primarily used to avoid naming conflicts in inheritance scenarios, but it also provides a stronger form of encapsulation than the single underscore convention.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iv) Using Getters and Setters:\n",
        "\n",
        "  A common way to achieve encapsulation and control access to attributes is by using getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Getter methods are used to retrieve the value of an attribute.\n",
        "  Setter methods are used to modify the value of an attribute.\n",
        "  By using getters and setters, you can add validation logic or other operations when accessing or modifying attributes, ensuring data integrity. This is a more explicit way to control access compared to relying solely on naming conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  v) Using the @property Decorator:\n",
        "\n",
        "  The @property decorator provides a Pythonic way to create getters and setters. It allows you to access methods as if they were attributes, making the code cleaner and more readable while still providing the benefits of encapsulation and controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when you create a new object (an instance) of that class. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes (data) and set up its initial state.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In Python, the constructor method is always named __init__ (with double underscores before and after). This naming convention is recognized by the Python interpreter, which automatically calls this method when an object is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The __init__ method takes at least one argument, conventionally named self. The self parameter refers to the instance of the object being created. It's a reference to the object itself, allowing you to access and modify its attributes within the constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "  You can define other parameters in the __init__ method to accept values that will be used to set the initial state of the object's attributes. These parameters are passed when you create an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Think of the constructor as the setup process for your object. When you create an object, the constructor gets executed, and it sets up the initial values for the object's properties. This ensures that the object is in a valid and usable state as soon as it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   __init__(self, ...):\n",
        "  \n",
        "  This is the signature of the constructor. self is always the first parameter and refers to the instance being created. The parameters that follow self are the values you want to pass when creating the object to initialize its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   self.attribute_name = value:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Inside the constructor, you typically assign the values passed as arguments to the object's attributes using self.attribute_name. This is how you give the newly created object its initial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Constructors are essential for ensuring that objects are properly set up when they are created, making your code more organized and preventing potential errors that could arise from using uninitialized objects. They provide a clear and standardized way to define the initial state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  In Python, class methods and static methods are types of methods that are defined within a class but behave differently from instance methods. They are distinguished by the decorators @classmethod and @staticmethod respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Instance Methods:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  These are the most common type of methods in Python classes. They operate on instances of the class and have access to the instance's attributes and other methods through the self parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Class Methods:\n",
        "      *   Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "      *   Class methods can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "      *   They are often used as alternative constructors (factory methods) that create instances of the class in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Static Methods:\n",
        "      *   Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "      *   Static methods do not have access to instance-specific data or class-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "      *   They are essentially regular functions that are defined within a class because they have some logical connection to the class, but they don't operate on the class or its instances. They are often used for utility functions related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->  Method overloading is a feature in some programming languages that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number of arguments or different types of arguments). The correct method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the arguments provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Python does not support method overloading in the same way as languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  If you define multiple methods with the same name in a Python class, the last defined method with that name will overwrite the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "  However, you can achieve similar functionality in Python using:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Default arguments: Define optional parameters with default values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs): Allow a method to accept a variable number of positional or keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Conditional logic: Use if-elif-else statements within a single method to handle different types or numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Function dispatch libraries: Libraries like functools.singledispatch can be used for single-dispatch generic functions based on the type of the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "  While Python doesn't have true method overloading, these techniques allow you to create flexible methods that can handle different inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->  Method overriding is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "  When a method is called on an object, and that method is defined in both the subclass and the superclass, the version of the method in the subclass is executed. This is because the subclass's implementation \"overrides\" the superclass's implementation for objects of the subclass type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key points about method overriding:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Same method signature:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The overriding method in the subclass must have the same name, number, and type of parameters as the method in the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Inheritance is required:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Method overriding can only happen in the context of inheritance, where a subclass inherits from a superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Runtime polymorphism:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Method overriding is a key mechanism for achieving runtime polymorphism. The specific method to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  *   super() function:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  In the overriding method of the subclass, you can use the super() function to call the implementation of the method in the superclass. This is useful if you want to extend the functionality of the superclass method rather than completely replace it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Method overriding allows subclasses to provide specialized behavior for methods that are generally defined in the superclass, enabling polymorphism and making code more flexible and extensible.\n",

        "\n",
        "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->  The @property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that provides a convenient way to define getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Without @property, you would typically define separate getter and setter methods to control access to an attribute and add validation or other logic.\n",

        "  \n",
        "  ->  Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that offers several key advantages, making code more flexible, maintainable, and extensible. Its importance stems from its ability to allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, using a single interface.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Here's why it's important:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) Increased Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Polymorphism allows you to write code that works with a general type (the superclass) and have it automatically work with any specific type (the subclass) that inherits from it. This means you can easily add new subclasses without modifying the existing code that uses the superclass, making your system more extensible and adaptable to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) Improved Code Reusability:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  By defining common interfaces in superclasses and using polymorphism, you can write reusable code that can operate on a variety of objects. This reduces code duplication and makes your codebase more concise and easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iii) Simplified Code and Reduced Complexity:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Polymorphism allows you to treat related objects in a uniform way, eliminating the need for cumbersome conditional statements (if-elif-else) to handle different object types. This simplifies your code, making it more readable and easier to understand.\n",

        "  \n",
        "  ->  The __call__ method in Python is a special \"dunder\" (double underscore) method. If a class defines this method, it means that instances of that class can be treated and called like functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  When you define the __call__ method in a class, you can call an object of that class by simply using parentheses () after the object's name, just like you would call a function. The code inside the __call__ method will be executed when the object is called in this way.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here's the purpose and significance of the __call__ method:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i) Making Objects Callable:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The primary purpose is to make instances of a class callable. This allows you to create objects that behave like functions, which can be useful in various programming scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii) Creating Function-like Objects:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  You can use __call__ to create objects that maintain state (attributes) and perform an action when called. This is different from a regular function, which doesn't typically maintain state between calls in the same way an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iii) Implementing Custom Behaviors:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  It allows you to define custom behavior for what happens when an object is \"called.\" This can be used for things like: Creating objects that act as decorators, Implementing objects that perform specific operations based on their internal state when called, Creating objects that act as function factories, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "  iv) Example:\n",
