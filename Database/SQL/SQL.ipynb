        "  i) NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.\n",

        "  Regarding primary keys, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is because a primary key is designed to uniquely identify each row in a table. If a primary key column allowed NULL values, it would be impossible to guarantee the unique identification of rows, as multiple rows could have a NULL value in the primary key column.
