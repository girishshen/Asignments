        "1) What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases are relational, schema-based, and use structured query language (SQL) for operations. They are ideal for structured data and support ACID transactions.  \n",
        "NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema-less or flexible-schema, and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They often scale horizontally and include types like document, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.  \n",
        "Key differences include data structure, scalability, schema flexibility, and consistency models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What makes MongoDB a good choice for modern applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, storing data in JSON-like BSON documents.  \n",
        "It is highly scalable, flexible with schema design, and supports high availability through replication and sharding.  \n",
        "Its features like dynamic queries, indexing, aggregation pipeline, and ease of horizontal scaling make it suitable for modern applications that require rapid development and large-scale data handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Explain the concept of collections in MongoDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "Collections in MongoDB are analogous to tables in SQL but are schema-less.  \n",
        "They group multiple documents (records) together. Each document can have a different structure, which provides flexibility.  \n",
        "Collections can be used to organize related data and support operations like querying, indexing, and aggregation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4) How does MongoDB ensure high availability using replication?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB uses replica sets, which consist of a primary node and one or more secondary nodes.  \n",
        "The primary node handles writes, while secondaries replicate data asynchronously.  \n",
        "If the primary fails, an election occurs, and a secondary is promoted to primary, ensuring continuous availability without data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are the main benefits of MongoDB Atlas?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service.  \n",
        "Benefits include:  \n",
        "- Automated backups and scaling  \n",
        "- Global distribution and high availability  \n",
        "- Security features like encryption and access control  \n",
        "- Monitoring and performance optimization tools  \n",
        "- Reduced operational overhead compared to self-managed MongoDB instances\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6) What is the role of indexes in MongoDB, and how do they improve performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in SQL; they speed up query operations by allowing efficient document retrieval.  \n",
        "Without indexes, MongoDB performs collection scans, which are slower.  \n",
        "Indexes can be created on one or multiple fields, support unique constraints, and optimize sorting and aggregation performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7) Describe the stages of the MongoDB aggregation pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "The aggregation pipeline processes data in stages, each transforming the documents:  \n",
        "- $match: Filters documents based on criteria  \n",
        "- $group: Groups documents and performs aggregation operations like sum, avg  \n",
        "- $project: Reshapes documents by including, excluding, or computing fields  \n",
        "- $sort: Sorts documents by specified fields  \n",
        "- $limit / $skip: Limits or skips documents  \n",
        "- $lookup: Performs joins with other collections  \n",
        "- $unwind: Deconstructs arrays into separate documents\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8) What is sharding in MongoDB? How does it differ from replication?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "Sharding is horizontal scaling, where data is distributed across multiple servers called shards.  \n",
        "Each shard contains a subset of the data, improving performance and storage capacity.  \n",
        "Replication, on the other hand, is about data redundancy and high availability, where copies of data are maintained in replica sets.  \n",
        "Sharding focuses on scaling, replication focuses on availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is PyMongo, and why is it used?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "PyMongo is the official Python driver for MongoDB.  \n",
        "It allows Python applications to connect to MongoDB, perform CRUD operations, execute aggregation pipelines, and manage collections and databases programmatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What are the ACID properties in the context of MongoDB transactions?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions. The ACID properties are:  \n",
        "- Atomicity: All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together  \n",
        "- Consistency: Transactions maintain database integrity  \n",
        "- Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other  \n",
        "- Durability: Once committed, changes persist even after a crash\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of MongoDB's explain() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "The explain() function shows how MongoDB executes a query.  \n",
        "It provides details about query plans, index usage, and performance metrics, helping developers optimize queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How does MongoDB handle schema validation?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB allows schema validation rules on collections.  \n",
        "Validation can enforce field types, required fields, value ranges, or custom rules.  \n",
        "While MongoDB is schema-less by default, schema validation ensures data consistency when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between a primary and a secondary node in a replica set?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "- Primary node: Handles all write operations and replicates data to secondaries  \n",
        "- Secondary node: Copies data from the primary and can serve read operations if configured  \n",
        "If the primary fails, a secondary is elected to become the new primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14) What security mechanisms does MongoDB provide for data protection?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",

        "- TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit  \n",
        "- Field-level and at-rest encryption  \n",
        "- Auditing to track access and changes\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15) Explain the concept of embedded documents and when they should be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedded documents store related data inside a single document rather than in separate collections.  \n",
        "They are used when data has a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship and is frequently accessed together, improving read performance and reducing joins.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16) What is the purpose of MongoDB's $lookup stage in aggregation?\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "$lookup performs a left outer join between collections within the aggregation pipeline.  \n",
        "It allows combining related data from multiple collections without multiple queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What are some common use cases for MongoDB?\n",

        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "- MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, similar to SQL transactions, but are optional since single-document operations are atomic by default.  \n",
        "- SQL transactions are natively built for relational databases and ACID compliance.  \n",

        "->\n",
        "\n",
        "$match filters documents in the pipeline based on a condition.  \n",
